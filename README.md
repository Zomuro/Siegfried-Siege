# Siegfried Siege

### Summary
Many fortresses have fallen to **Siegfried**, whose experiences have taught him how to efficiently shatter and build fortifications. 
Under his command, pawns will destroy buildings twice as fast while constructing them 30% faster. But beware! 
In the thick of combat, their need for food is doubled.

Otherwise, his tales will reflect the unpredictability of war.

### Additional Lore

For a tale of the legend himself, come and [listen to your commanding officer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15LEM6i5B2rZfKaWKGR9AmZdsa3zUhIB7tEkYzTFL8ZE/edit?usp=sharing).


## FAQ

* **Can I use the code in here?**

Yes. Preferably with crediting all the people who contributed to this storyteller.

* **What about the art?**

You'll want to ask first. If we give you our blessings, you're clear.

* **I don't like how fast pawns build stuff, or starve, or break buildings.**

You can change all those values in this mod's settings. Don't like your pawn getting the munchies during a firefight? Lower the hunger rate multiplier. 
Do the same for all the other stuff.

The summary will continue to reflect the default values, however.

## Credits

My warmest thanks go to:
* **DetVisor**, for the concept of the big man himself and the enchanted steel he wears. This mod was made for him.
* **Visandar_the_Unliving**, for his incredible art of Siegfried.
